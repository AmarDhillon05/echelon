## Welcome to Echelon
Echelon is an app aiming to bring more interactive features to hackathons without 
needing to organize events or games in-person. It currently adds features including 
a modernized UI, quick ELO-based matchmaking, and social-media like scrolling to make 
it more interactive, as well as supports functions like importing from Devpost, to 
make it easy to use in competitive scenes

Echelon is made unique by relying on modern storage and AI technologies for interactivity. 
Its primary feature, quick matchmaking, as well as future planned features, are build on 
lightweight embeddings generated from pretrained models and used to host submissions in 
pinecone, to quickly deliver similar and fairly matched submissions. Models such as Mistral 
are used for text refinement, and Codestral for generating prettier HTML for others to view
on submissions. We later plan on improving the scrolling experience with AI, to make it an 
activity people are bound to use hours and hours on instead of coding their submissions.

Stay tuned for updates and an official beta!
